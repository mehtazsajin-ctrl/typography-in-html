    <h1>Isagi</h1>
    <p>
    Isagi is easygoing and has a generally friendly, cheery personality, but his simple and innocent habits often get on the nerves of the people around him. He tends to avoid any childish squabbles among other Blue Lock competitors and tries to be a peacekeeper between his friends and rivals. At the beginning of Blue Lock, Isagi is massively unsure of himself and his skill due to being the second-lowest-ranked player in Blue Lock initially and his conflicting ideas of football. As time goes on, Isagi develops a more assertive presence on and off the field, becoming the foundation for Team Z and garnering the respect of some of the best players in Blue Lock, who mostly have heavily assertive or dominant personalities. As of Third Selection, Isagi has the confidence, charisma, and reputation to talk openly with Rin Itoshi, one of the most talented yet difficult people in the Blue Lock Project.
